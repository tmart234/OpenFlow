### NOAA Datasets
GHCND (Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily):
GHCND is a comprehensive daily weather dataset that includes observations from land-based weather stations across the globe. It contains daily data on various weather variables, such as precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, maximum and minimum temperature, and other weather elements. GHCND is the most extensive dataset among the three and is used for climate monitoring, weather forecasting, and climate research.
    A comprehensive daily dataset provides detailed weather data collected at regular intervals (e.g., hourly or sub-hourly) throughout the day for each station.

    The five core values are:
        PRCP = Precipitation (mm or inches as per user preference, inches to hundredths on Daily Form pdf file)
        SNOW = Snowfall (mm or inches as per user preference, inches to tenths on Daily Form pdf file)
        SNWD = Snow depth (mm or inches as per user preference, inches on Daily Form pdf file)
        TMAX = Maximum temperature (Fahrenheit or Celsius as per user preference)
        TMIN = Minimum temperature (Fahrenheit or Celsius as per user prefernces)

GHCNM (Global Historical Climatology Network - Monthly):
GHCNM is a subset of GHCND that provides monthly summaries of temperature and precipitation data from land-based weather stations worldwide. The dataset contains mean, maximum, and minimum temperature values, as well as total precipitation, for each month. GHCNM is used primarily for climate monitoring, trend analysis, and climate change studies at a monthly timescale.

GSOD (Global Surface Summary of the Day):
GSOD is a daily weather dataset that is derived from the Integrated Surface Dataset (ISD). It contains weather data from land-based weather stations and ships worldwide, with each record summarizing 24 hours of weather observations. The dataset includes variables such as temperature, dew point, sea-level pressure, wind speed and direction, visibility, and precipitation. GSOD data is primarily used for aviation purposes, weather forecasting, and climate research.
    a summary dataset aggregates the data over a certain period, such as daily or monthly, providing average, maximum, or minimum values for each weather variable.
